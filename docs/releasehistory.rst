Version 0.6.0 (Mar 10, 2020)
===================================
- Re-designed the API of :py:mod:`adtk.visualization.plot`
- Removed :py:mod:`adtk.data.resample` because its functionality is highly overlapped with pandas resampler module
- Made :py:mod:`adtk.data.expand_events` accept events in the form of pandas Series/DataFrame
- Made :py:mod:`adtk.data.expand_events` accept time delta in the form of `str` or `int`
- Changed the output type of :py:mod:`adtk.data.split_train_test` from a 2-tuple of lists to a list of 2-tuples
- Turned the following model parameters required from optional

    - `window` in :py:mod:`adtk.detector.LevelShiftAD`
    - `window` in :py:mod:`adtk.detector.VolatilityShiftAD`
    - `window` in :py:mod:`adtk.transformer.RollingAggregate`
    - `window` in :py:mod:`adtk.transformer.DoubleRollingAggregate`
    - `model` in :py:mod:`adtk.detector.MinClusterDetector`
    - `model` in :py:mod:`adtk.detector.OutlierDetector`
    - `target` and `regressor` in :py:mod:`adtk.detector.RegressionAD`
    - `target` and `regressor` in :py:mod:`adtk.transformer.RegressionResidual`
    - `aggregate_func` in :py:mod:`adtk.aggregator.CustomizedAggregator`
    - `detect_func` in :py:mod:`adtk.detector.CustomizedDetector1D`
    - `detect_func` in :py:mod:`adtk.detector.CustomizedDetectorHD`
    - `transform_func` in :py:mod:`adtk.transformer.CustomizedTransformer1D`
    - `transform_func` in :py:mod:`adtk.detector.CustomizedTransformer1D`
    - `steps` in :py:mod:`adtk.pipe.Pipeline`

- Added consistency check between training and testing inputs in multivariate models
- Improved time index check in time-dependent models
- Turned all second-order sub-modules private, and a user now can only import from the following first-order modules

    - :py:mod:`adtk.detector`
    - :py:mod:`adtk.transformer`
    - :py:mod:`adtk.aggregator`
    - :py:mod:`adtk.pipe`
    - :py:mod:`adtk.data`
    - :py:mod:`adtk.metrics`
    - :py:mod:`adtk.visualization`

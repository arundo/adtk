Installation
============

Prerequisites: Python 3.5 or later.

It is recommended to install the most recent **stable** release of ADTK from PyPI.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install adtk


Alternatively, you could install from source code. This will give you the **latest**, but unstable, version of ADTK.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/arundo/adtk.git
    $ cd adtk/
    $ git checkout develop
    $ pip install ./
